I'm an MSc student working with [Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun) and [Sanja Fidler](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fidler) at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing.

I enjoy learning about new programming languages, and am particularly fond of functional languages like [Scheme](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) and [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/).
